# Lua-first Platform tools

This directory contains Platform-only declaration, native-registration, public
contract, and synchronization checks for the Lua runtime inherited by CPH from CCB.  The
authoritative LuaLS declaration is
`data/lua/types/ccb_platform_v1.d.lua`; native registration is discovered from
the workspace's `src/lua_platform_*` files.

The final generated reference outputs are:

- `data/lua/reference/ccb_platform_native_inventory.json`
- `data/lua/reference/ccb_platform_api_v1.json`
- `data/lua/reference/ccb_platform_api_v1_coverage.json`

Their explicit schemas are:

- `data/lua/reference/ccb_platform_native_inventory.schema.json`
- `data/lua/reference/ccb_platform_api_v1.schema.json`
- `data/lua/reference/ccb_platform_api_v1_coverage.schema.json`

The first output is produced by
`generate_platform_native_inventory.py`. The public-contract generator reads
that inventory plus the LuaLS declaration and validates its output against the
Platform v1 schema. The synchronization-coverage generator compares LuaLS
classes, native registration roots, and the public contract, also using its
explicit schema. Its result is not JSON/EOC migration parity or a historical
API coverage score.

The single repository contract gate includes the five live contract checks
and their tool regressions (individual checker CLIs remain diagnostic tools):

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/lua_api -p 'test_*.py'
```

No historical API v5/CBN contract, authored manifest, capability sandbox, or
global `game.*` surface is part of the Platform workflow.

## Mod author quick start

```sh
python3 tools/create_lua_mod.py /path/MyMod --template complete
```

Open the generated directory as a workspace in a LuaLS-enabled editor. The
scaffolder adds `.luarc.json` and `.ccb-sdk/ccb.lua` automatically. The SDK file
is a byte-for-byte snapshot of the selected release/checkout's LuaLS declaration;
`version.json` records Platform v1, Lua 5.4 and its SHA-256. Game packages already
include `data/lua/types/ccb_platform_v1.d.lua`; select the file from the actual
target game with `--declarations /path/game/data/lua/types/ccb_platform_v1.d.lua`.
This identifies editor declarations, not the executable currently running or a
promise of native/save compatibility. SDK files never auto-update.

The editor configuration provides completion and API diagnostics, resolves
`require("ccb")` to the SDK, and loads local author modules. The game continues
to provide its real `ccb` module. `.luarc.json` and `.ccb-sdk/` are optional
editor metadata, not a runtime manifest or executable content; omit them with
`--no-editor` or exclude them when packaging. Both templates check the Platform
major version before registering content. An exact declaration revision check
is an author upgrade aid, not a new mandatory runtime version system.

## Add an editor SDK to an existing Mod

```sh
python3 tools/lua_api/mod_sdk.py init /path/ExistingMod \
  --declarations /path/game/data/lua/types/ccb_platform_v1.d.lua
```

This adds the frozen `.ccb-sdk/` snapshot and `.luarc.json` editor configuration
used by the scaffolder. It does not execute or modify author Lua files. Existing SDKs or
editor configuration are never overwritten; keep or integrate them manually.
A failed initialization removes only files created by that attempt. Without
`--declarations`, the tool snapshots its own checkout's declaration file.
The added JSON files configure the editor and are not runtime manifests.

## Diagnose a Mod

With LuaLS installed (the CI/editor gate is tested with 3.19.1):

```sh
python3 tools/lua_api/mod_sdk.py check /path/MyMod
```

`--language-server /absolute/path/to/lua-language-server` selects an existing
server without installing one. Diagnostics include clickable absolute file,
line and column, a diagnostic code, and LuaLS's actual/expected type explanation.
Exit 0 means no warnings/errors in this static check; 1 means diagnostics;
2 means invalid SDK/setup or a failed checker. A crashed or silent checker is
never reported as a pass. This checks author files using the frozen declarations;
it does not audit the declaration library itself, execute callbacks, validate
native content IDs, or prove gameplay/save correctness. The library has existing
annotation gaps, so dynamically typed/undeclared portions need runtime validation.

Lua runtime failures still use the engine's existing Mod/handler context and
Lua error text in `debug.log`. The SDK checker does not add an in-game debugger. The separate saved-state
inspector below reads persisted records without starting the game. Use the game's existing `--check-mods` path for actual
loading, and exercise the affected behavior for runtime acceptance.

## Inspect saved state without starting the game

```sh
python3 tools/lua_api/inspect_state.py /path/world/lua_platform_world.json
python3 tools/lua_api/inspect_state.py /path/player.lua_platform.json --mod MyMod
python3 tools/lua_api/inspect_state.py /path/player.lua_platform.json --mod MyMod --task 225
python3 tools/lua_api/inspect_state.py /path/player.lua_platform.json --values --limit 50
```

The inspector reads one explicit Platform v1 save file and emits JSON containing
saved Mod owners, state key/type summaries, task IDs, handler names, due turns,
recurrence intervals and saved participant/actor records. State/payload values are
included only with `--values`. Actor output includes only native identity/hint
fields and checks their range, completeness and mutual exclusivity.
Each displayed list defaults to 20 entries; total counts
remain visible, and `--limit` accepts 1–200. It never executes Mod metadata or Lua,
loads native libraries, resolves participants against a world, or rewrites the
save. The world and character files are separate scopes; inspect both when a Mod
uses both. Use `--mod MyMod --task ID` to follow a task ID from an error message,
including records beyond the displayed list limit. Task IDs are local to a Mod,
so the task filter requires a Mod ID. Total and matched task counts stay separate.

An absent/uninstalled Mod can still have a retained saved record. Finding a
record does not establish that its handler currently exists, its participants
are live, or its task will run. This is a saved-snapshot diagnostic, not a runtime
debugger or a replacement for the engine's save loader. Basic malformed input,
duplicate IDs/members and unsupported versions produce an error and exit code 2;
successful inspection returns 0. A report is not full save compatibility proof.

The Python tool regressions exercise snapshot reporting and malformed input.
Actual restoration still requires the native game and its acceptance checks.

## Review an API upgrade

Compare directly with the target game's bundled declaration file:

```sh
python3 tools/lua_api/mod_sdk.py compare-release /path/MyMod \
  --declarations /path/TargetGame/data/lua/types/ccb_platform_v1.d.lua
```

This requires no second scaffold, never executes Lua, and leaves both the Mod's
SDK and the target file unchanged. The report records the absolute target path
and declaration hash; you explicitly choose which game package to inspect.

Alternatively, compare two existing SDK snapshots:

```sh
python3 tools/lua_api/mod_sdk.py compare /path/OldMod /path/NewVersionScaffold
```

The JSON report shows the two SDK identities and added, removed, or changed
class/field/function and alias declarations, including parameter/return annotations
and consecutive multiline alias members (`---|`).
It never overwrites either project. Review changed declarations, read the game's
release/migration notes, then intentionally update the editor SDK and rerun static
and affected runtime checks. Unchanged signatures do not prove behavior parity;
the tool does not invent replacement APIs for removed symbols.

For an interface change, maintainers should explain its concrete before/after
behavior, replacement API if one exists, and save/data implications in release
notes. Preserve supported calls where practical or mark deprecation in LuaLS;
a signature report supplements that explanation, not a compatibility runtime.

## Editor acceptance

CI downloads a SHA-256-pinned LuaLS binary and runs the two real editor tests
once, separately from the fast tool tests. Locally, set `CCB_LUALS` to run them
inside the normal contract suite (otherwise they are explicitly skipped):

```sh
CCB_LUALS=/path/lua-language-server python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/lua_api -p 'test_*.py'
python3 tools/test_create_lua_mod.py
```

The editor gate checks both real templates and deliberately invalid author code
for unknown APIs, missing arguments and wrong argument types. It is a static
acceptance gate and does not trigger a C++ build or a full content audit.

The saved-state inspector also reports each Mod's `last_task_id` and
`task_counter_persisted`. New counter-bearing records retain allocated IDs even
with no pending tasks. For older records, the displayed counter is derived only
from remaining task IDs; completed IDs cannot be reconstructed. Counters outside
the signed task-ID range, or below a stored task ID, are rejected.

## Extract translations (draft API)

The independent localization implementation adds `ccb.services.translate(text,
context?)` and `ccb.services.translate_plural(singular, plural, count, context?)`.
These calls use the current native game catalog after `world_ready`. They return
plain strings; they do not create deferred translation objects for content names
or Mod metadata. Missing entries return source text (singular for count 1,
plural otherwise). Negative counts, counts outside native `size_t`, and embedded
NUL in text/context are rejected. No new catalog registry or Lua interpreter is
introduced. Native loading, locale switching and plural-rule acceptance remain
pending; source implementation is not a shipped-compatibility claim.

Write full calls with literal messages and optional literal context:

```lua
local ccb = require("ccb")
ccb.runtime.handler("translated_ready", function()
    ccb.services.message(ccb.services.translate("Ready", "MyMod status"))
    local count = 2
    local message = ccb.services.translate_plural(
        "%d item is ready", "%d items are ready", count, "MyMod status")
    ccb.services.message(string.format(message, count))
end)
ccb.runtime.on("world_ready", "translated_ready")
```

Static Item names and descriptions instead accept deferred values. Plain strings
remain untranslated. Skill fields also accept singular markers as described below;
other content builders and Mod metadata do not yet accept these values. Source forms must be nonempty and all arguments must exclude NUL:

```lua
local ccb = require("ccb")
ccb.content.add(ccb.content.Item {
    id = "MyMod_water_bottle", mass_grams = 500, volume_ml = 500,
    name = ccb.content.plural_text("bottle of water", "bottles of water", "MyMod item"),
    description = ccb.content.text("A sealed bottle.", "MyMod description")
})
```

These immutable values preserve source text for native translation when displayed,
including after a language change. Descriptions reject plural values. A name
marked with `text` uses the same source as its plural fallback; use `plural_text`
for distinct forms. Inheritance preserves an omitted translated field, while an
explicit plain string replaces it. Changes to text context, plural forms or
translation status require static content reload. Native/locale acceptance remains
pending; the extractor's passing checks alone do not prove game integration.

Use GNU `xgettext` to extract explicitly named source files without executing
Lua. Run from the Mod root for stable relative references:

```sh
python3 /path/cph/tools/lua_api/extract_translations.py main.lua runtime/status.lua --output messages.pot
python3 /path/cph/tools/lua_api/extract_translations.py main.lua runtime/status.lua --output messages.pot --check
```

The tool does not traverse directories. It stages output before replacing the
POT so write failures preserve the previous template; output cannot alias an
input source. `--check` does not write; exit 1 means a
missing/stale POT and exit 2 means extraction/setup failure. Output is stable for
unchanged inputs and the same xgettext version. Calls through renamed aliases,
computed messages, and dynamic contexts cannot be extracted reliably: keep the
full `ccb.services.translate`/`translate_plural` or `ccb.content.text`/`plural_text`
spelling and literals. Review the POT after extraction.
An immediately preceding `-- TRANSLATORS: ...` comment is retained for translators;
ordinary implementation comments are not added to the template.
Formatting is a separate Lua operation; translators must preserve placeholders.
For automatic gettext format flags, nest the translation call directly inside
`string.format(ccb.services.translate("%d items", "MyMod status"), count)`.
A translation stored in an intermediate variable cannot inherit that static
format-use information.

Translate the POT into PO catalogs with normal gettext tooling. For an external
Mod under the game's configured user Mod directory, the existing native scanner
accepts `MyMod/lang/mo/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/MyMod.mo`; language is taken from
the parent of `LC_MESSAGES`. Catalog compilation/installation is a separate
release step. Bundled Mod catalogs are not automatically discovered by that
user-directory scan. The native registry is shared: use a distinctive context
for ambiguous/common messages. This batch does not change catalog precedence or
add live catalog reload. Restart the game after installing changed catalogs.

The same `ccb.content.text` marker is accepted by Skill names/descriptions,
SkillDisplay labels and Skill theory/practice level descriptions. These fields
reject plural markers and keep ordinary strings literal. Use the full helper
name with literal source/context arguments so the existing extractor can find
these strings; no separate Skill extraction command is required.
