These instructions are built around pretty standard linux command line tools, plus sqlite3 and moreutils.

First, retrieve the .csv files from https://www.mass.gov/info-details/data-about-firearms-licensing-and-transactions
You want both 'Download: Firearms Dealer Transactions <date range>' and 'Download: Personal Transfers and Registrations - <date range>'

Translate the date fields to ISO-8601 like so `sed "s_\([^/,]*\)/\([^/,]*\)/\([^/,]*\),\(.*\)_20\3-\1-\2,\4_g" 01.01.23-12.31.23.csv`

Remove frst line from all but the first sales csv like so
tail -2 01.01.09-12.31.21.iso.date.csv | sponge 01.01.09-12.31.21.iso.date.csv
tail -2 01.01.22-12.31.22.iso.date.csv | sponge 01.01.22-12.31.22.iso.date.csv
tail -2 01.01.23-12.31.23.iso.date.csv | sponge 01.01.23-12.31.23.iso.date.csv

Create a database, add a table like so:

Import each file into the database like so:
.mode csv
.import personal_transactions.iso.date.csv personal_transactions
.import 01.01.04-12.31.08.iso.date.csv sales
.import 01.01.09-12.31.21.iso.date.csv sales
.import 01.01.22-12.31.22.iso.date.csv sales
.import 01.01.23-12.31.23.iso.date.csv sales

Filter and rename the personal transactions columns while copying into a new table like so:
CREATE TABLE gun_data AS SELECT "TRANSACTION DATE" as date, "BUYER STATE" as state, MAKE as make, MODEL as model, TYPE as type, "SERIAL NUMBER" as serial, "WEAPON SIZE" as ammo_type FROM personal_transactions;

Filter and rename the sales columns while coping into the just created table like so:
INSERT INTO gun_data SELECT "DATE OF TRANSACTION" as date, "BUYER STATE" as state, MAKE as make, MODEL as model, "WEAPON TYPE" as type, "SERIAL NUMBER" as serial, "WEAPON SIZE" as ammo_type FROM sales;

Drop the intermediate tables.
DROP TABLE sales;
DROP TABLE personal_transactions;
VACUUM;
Possibly save and reload the database here?

Run "script" to deduplicate the "not available" values for serial number.
.read fix_serial_numbers.sql
Run "script" to remove empty lines
.read remove_empty_entroes.sql

Deduplicate rows with matching serial fields, with latest date winning.
CREATE INDEX gun_data_idx_deduplication_query ON gun_data(serial, date);
DELETE FROM gun_data WHERE rowid IN (SELECT q1.rowid from gun_data q1 JOIN gun_data q2 on q1.serial = q2.serial WHERE q1.serial != "NONE" AND q1.date < q2.date);
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS gun_data_idx_deduplication_query;

Remove rows with a state field not equal to MA
DELETE FROM gun_data WHERE state != "MA" AND state != "";

Now you're ready to start fixing data entry errors.
From this point on we don't use the date and state fields.

Basically we have a big list of incorrectly spelled values for particular fields along with the correct spelling.
Then we have a script that will spit out SQL statements to make these substitutions happen.
