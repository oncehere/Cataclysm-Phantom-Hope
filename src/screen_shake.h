// Sound-driven screen shake: a loud nearby sound (currently only explosions) gives
// the whole frame a quick, damped jolt at present time. Like the shockwave, it is a
// present-time blit transform — here a few-pixel translation of display_buffer
// rather than a mesh warp — and it decays over real wall-clock time (the same
// per-frame steady_clock advance the explosion-light overlay uses). No GPU shader,
// uses the shared SDL renderer, and is fully gated by a settings toggle + threshold.

// Live shake parameters. A single global impulse (concurrent triggers take the
// stronger one rather than summing, so a chain of blasts doesn't fling the view).
