/**
 * Snapshot-based multi-save system.
 *
 * Because NPCs, factions, missions, the map and the overmap are all
 * world-level state in CDDA (stored in master.gsav / maps/ / overmaps/),
 * the only way to capture a self-consistent, isolated save is to snapshot
 * the ENTIRE world directory. A snapshot is therefore a recursive copy of
 * a world's folder (excluding the snapshots/ subfolder itself).
 *
 * This pairs with the one-character-per-world enforcement: one world holds
 * exactly one character plus its world state, so a world snapshot is a clean
 * "save slot".
 *
 * These functions operate purely on disk and are decoupled from any running
 * game: callers that have a live game must persist it (game::save) before
 * snapshotting and reload it (game::reload_active_save) after restoring.
