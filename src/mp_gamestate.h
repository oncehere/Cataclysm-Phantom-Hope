// MP DIAG 2026-08-30 — HOSTACT probe.
//
// DIAGNOSING: "can a HOST activity begin and end between two state broadcasts,
// so the client never observes the transition?"
//
// Why the question exists: the two directions of the partner-activity sync use
// different mechanisms.  client->host is EDGE driven — assign_activity emits an
// explicit activity_start action and the tick path emits activity_end, so an
// edge cannot be missed.  host->client is LEVEL driven — the host stamps
// "host_activity" into serialize_remote_player_state() and the client samples
// whatever the last packet happened to carry.  A host activity whose whole life
// falls between two broadcasts is therefore invisible to the client: no
// "<host> begins ...", no "<host> has finished ...".
//
// This is NOT the (retracted) "host never sends its activity" claim — the field
// is written at mp_gamestate.cpp, in serialize_remote_player_state().  This
// probe measures whether the SAMPLING RATE is ever too coarse for it.
//
// Reading the output — host log:
//   HOSTACT[edge-vs-sample] OPEN   id=X turn=N src=assign|poll|send
//   HOSTACT[edge-vs-sample] SENT   id=X turn=N first_send_after_ms=K
//   HOSTACT[edge-vs-sample] CLOSE  id=X turn=N lived_turns=L sends=S   <- S>0 = fine
//   HOSTACT[edge-vs-sample] DROPPED id=X turn=N lived_turns=L sends=0  <- THE BUG
// client log:
//   HOSTACT[edge-vs-sample] RECV   prev=X now=Y turn=N
//
// A single DROPPED line proves the defect and names the activity.  Zero DROPPED
// over a session with plenty of short host activities (pickup, drop, wield,
// reload) falsifies it — and note that a DROPPED for an id nobody cares about
// is not automatically worth fixing; weigh it against what the client's HUD and
// the "begins/finished" announcements actually need.
//
// Cross-check without reading individual lines:
//   grep -c 'HOSTACT.*OPEN' ~/cdda-mp-server.log   # host activity instances
//   grep -c 'HOSTACT.*RECV' ~/cdda-mp-client.log   # transitions the client saw
// A large shortfall on the client side is the same finding in aggregate.
