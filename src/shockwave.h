// frame is rendered into an offscreen texture (display_buffer) and blitted to the
// window once per frame; when a shockwave is active that blit is done through a
// distorted triangle mesh, refracting the already-rendered scene (including the
// phase-one light overlay) along an expanding ring. No GPU shader is involved, so
// it uses the shared SDL renderer.

// Live shockwave parameters, expressed entirely in screen pixels so the present
// path can consume them without any tile/coordinate context. The explosion light
// frame renderer rebuilds the active set each frame (one per blast that has a
// shockwave); the present-time warp blit reads them and sums their displacements.
