// Intent telegraph (v1, display-only).
//
// In lockstep, whichever player is currently deliberating is the one holding a
// grant -- which means their partner is, by construction, the one blocked
// waiting on them.  The blocked player's movement keys are dropped today (see
// the DROP path in handle_action.cpp's mp_dispatch, and HOST-LOCKED-BLOCK), so
// they carry information that is simply thrown away.  Instead we stage the last
// direction pressed and ship it to the partner, who draws a faint hint tile one
// step that way.  The result is that the hint always points AT the person who
// is currently deciding, and it lasts exactly as long as their deliberation.
//
// The staged intent NEVER executes.  It is a hint, not an input buffer -- the
// player still presses the key again once they have a grant.  Making it fire on
// grant is v2 (see ROADMAP: "Intent telegraphing"), and needs a veto list
// because CDDA kills you for one accidental step.

// as "holding", and it fires constantly because pause is the key you mash while
// thinking.  A pause key now simply clears any staged intent, which is honest --
// they are no longer thinking about stepping anywhere.
