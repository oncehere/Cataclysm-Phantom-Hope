// --- Client summon registration (ROADMAP B1) ------------------------------
//
// Measured 2026-08-25: a spell-summoned monster on the client is placed with
// mp_net_id == 0, and apply_monster_sync's in-region cull removes it on the
// very next sync -- 42ms after the cast, with the mana and material components
// already spent.  Net ids are only ever assigned host-side, so a client summon
// can never survive on its own.
//
// Fix is host authority, matching how the fork already handles vehicles and
// melee: the client does NOT keep its local copy.  It tells the host what to
// place and deletes its own, the host places the real monster and assigns the
// net id, and the ordinary monster broadcast delivers it back a tick later as a
// normal shared monster.  Costs one round-trip (~40ms local, ~100ms WAN)
// against a multi-thousand-move cast, and needs no new sync machinery or cull
// exemption afterwards.
//
// Called from add_summoned_mon() (magic_spell_effect.cpp), which every
// Magiclysm summon funnels through -- EOC_SUMMON_ZOMBIE and friends are only
// level-based selectors that re-cast a sub-spell with a plain `summon` effect.
// `summon_turns` is 0 for a PERMANENT summon.  No-op unless we are the client
// and the caster is our own avatar.

void mp_handle_client_summon( const std::string &msg );

// --- Deliberate client HP changes (ROADMAP B2) ----------------------------
//
// The host's proxy HP is authoritative: apply_monster_sync's sibling, the
// bodyparts applier, does an unconditional set_part_hp_cur() with the host's
// value.  So anything the CLIENT does to its own HP is discarded on the next
// sync -- a Restoration self-heal is reverted, and an Animist HP cost is
// refunded, which is a cheat rather than a mere break.
//
// Measured 2026-08-25: that overwrite fires CONSTANTLY, 2448 times in one
// session with deltas of +1..+5, because the client's avatar and the host's
// proxy each run their own natural regen.  That measurement is why this is an
// EXPLICIT EVENT channel and not the HP-diff channel originally specced:
// natural regen goes through Character::heal() -> mod_part_hp_cur(), the very
// same chokepoint spells use, so a diff (or a blind hook) would report the
// client's regen to a host that is already computing its own and the character
// would double-heal.  Contamination is continuous, so no threshold filters it.
//
// Instead, reporting is ARMED only around genuinely deliberate changes.  Scope
// one of these around the mutation and nothing else is ever reported.

// (CLI-HP-EVENT arm_l -15) and emitted no corresponding heal event at all,
// because the thing healed was not an avatar.
//
// Returns true when it has taken responsibility for this target: the spell was
// forwarded and the caller must NOT apply it locally.  False means "not mine",
// and the normal SP path runs unchanged.
//
// v1 forwards DELIBERATE SUPPORT ONLY -- spells that accept `ally` but not
// `hostile`.  A spell that accepts both is an area attack that caught the
// partner incidentally, and forwarding it would need the whole blast geometry
// re-resolved on the far side to be correct; those keep today's behavior
// (partner untouched) until that is worth building.  Of the 124 Magiclysm
