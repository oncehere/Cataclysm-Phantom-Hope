This folder contains the Lua 5.4.8 library source code, compiled into builds
that enable the Lua Platform runtime inherited by CPH from CCB.  Only redundant blank lines at the ends of
upstream files are normalized for the repository's whitespace checks.

The source archive is published at
<https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.8.tar.gz> and has SHA-256:

```

The standalone `lua.c` and `luac.c` front ends are intentionally not vendored;
CPH embeds the library and does not ship a separate unrestricted interpreter.
